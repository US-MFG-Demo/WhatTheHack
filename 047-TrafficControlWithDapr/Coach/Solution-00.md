# Challenge 0 - Install local tools and Azure prerequisites - Coach's Guide

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Solution-01.md)

## Notes & Guidance

The expectation is that the Coach will zip up the `/Student/Resources` directory as a "Resources.zip" file and give it to the students separately. It contains all of the source code files.

The most common errors are not installing all the prerequisites or credential problems due to having to connect to several different services (Azure, Azure Container Registy, Azure Kubernetes Service, kubectl, etc)
